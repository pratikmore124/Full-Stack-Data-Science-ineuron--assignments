    "\n",
    "2. When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called?\n",

    "\n",
    "6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?\n",

    "ans None\n",
    "\n",
    "9. How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?\n",
    "ANS- We can use Global keyword to declare which variabel is global.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is the data type of None?\n",
    "NoneType\n",
    "\n",
