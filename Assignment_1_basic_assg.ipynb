    "Q1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be\n",
    "integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "*        - Expression\n",
    "\"hello\"  - Value\n",
    "-87.8    - Values\n",
    "-        - Expression\n",

    "Q2. What is the difference between string and variable?\n",
    "ANS-> String                                                   Variable \n",
    "    1.String is Value representing text                  1.Variable is a name  that stores the value\n",
    "    2.exaple- \"abc\"                                      2.example- name\n",
    "    \n",
    "Q3. Describe three different data types.\n",
    "ANS-> Data types is what type of value that is stored in variable, it can be sttring , integer, mathamatical expression, that can be applied to it without causing error. There are many different data types used in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Integer- Integer is number that can be in decimal , positive, negative. e.g 2.3, 43.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. String - String is a value representing some text, which can be alphabets, alphanumeric values. e.g \"Aman\", \"dfr23v\".\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Boolen - These are value which can we either be True or False. The True indicate that the value or condition is valid and False indicate value of condition is not valid\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?\n",
    "ANS Expressions are made up of opreators and opreand with different type mathamatical operators such as * , / , + , -.\n",
    "They work with eachother with some set rules and produce some desired results. \n",
    "\n",
    "+ - Addition, add two integer value \n",
    "- - Subtraction, it produuce difference between two values\n",
    "* - Multiplication, produce result of repeated addition of same number\n",
    "/ - Division, it vis opposite of multiplication, it is act of splitting of whole into pieces\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an\n",
    "expression and a statement?\n",
    "Ans- An expression is combination of values and function, that is done some opreation by compiler and producting some results. Statement is a standalone text which do not produce any other results.\n",
    "- Like in statement spam=10, here \"spam\" is a variable storing a vale as 10, this variable \"spam\" , can then be used for some mathameticak opreation changing its value.\n",

    "Q6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?\n",
    "bacon = 22\n",
    "bacon + 1\n",
    "Ans-> 22\n",
    "as bacon=22, here bacon is variable set value as 22, the bacon + 1 was done, this will not change the value of bacon as new value is noty again reassigned to bacon. So Bacon vale remain unchange.\n",

    "Q7. What should the values of the following two terms be?\n",
    "\"spam\" + \"spamspam\";\n",

    "Q8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?\n",
    "Ans. In Python, the interpreter do  not allow variable name to start from numeric value.\n",

    "Q9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string\n",
